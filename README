This is a maven project [1] of D2RQ [2] that is based on sources from [3] (and some additional patches that are currently submitted as pull request, see [6]). It hopefully includes (more or less ;) ) D2RQ sources only, i.e. no D2RS sources. These are separately available as a maven project which can be found at [4]. A generated jar file of these sources can be found at [5].
